# ssh-config-update -- update ~/.ssh/config depending based on location

# I use ssh aliases extensively for sshfs bookmarks, svn/git/hg
# destinations, and (of course) remote logins.  Because my router doesn't
# route packets from the LAN interface to its own WAN interface (i.e., via
# the WAN IP), I can't use a single IP address both inside and outside my
# home subnet: at home, I need to use an IP address on the local subnet,
# but outside I need the WAN IP address (with appropriate router
# configuration).
#
# This script updates ~/.ssh/config to provide a single, stable alias for
# each destination.
