"""replace unquoted empty fields with NULL, Ã  la postgresql's copy

TSV and CSV formats do not specify how to distinguish unquoted empty
strings from NULL values. This script assumes a convention that empty
strings will be quoted, and therefore that empty fields represent
NULLs, and makes this explicit by replacing empty fields with the
(unquoted) string NULL.  Postgresql (psql) will use this
quasi-convention to distinguish empty strings from NULL values.

Note that this script will not work with files that have tabs embedded
within quoted strings.
