My PYTHONPATH setup looks like this:

export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/opt/python-modules:$HOME/opt/reece-external/lib/python${PYTHONPATH:+:$PYTHONPATH}

With that, an example package installation is:
easy_install -d ~/opt/reece-external/lib/python hg-git
OR
easy_install -d ~/opt/python-modules hg-git

(I put modules that I want to share among my installations into
reece-external, and those I want to isolate into python-modules.)
